It's just a quick post to say hello to everybody who plans to follow my Google Summer of Code project,
which is about implementing a HTTP/2 prototype server in node.js. I will blog about it weekly to keep
you informed.

The information page of the project on the GSoC2013 website is [this][1]. I will be happy
to email you the full proposal if you are interested, but I don't want to share it publicly since
it contains personal information.

The project is [hosted on GitHub][2], and will be available as an [npm module][3].

The Atom feed of my GSoC related blog posts is <a href="http://gabor.molnar.es/blog/categories/google-summer-of-code/atom.xml">this</a>.
